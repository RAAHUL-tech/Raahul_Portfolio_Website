  <h3>Face Emotion Recognition</h3>
  <p>July 2023 – September 2023 | Python, Tensorflow, Keras</p><br>
  <p>This project is built using Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet. Face emotion recognition is implemented using various deep learning frameworks, with the goal of classifying input images into one of seven emotions: 0 = Angry, 1 = Disgust, 2 = Fear, 3 = Happy, 4 = Sad, 5 = Surprise, and 6 = Neutral. The well-known FER-2013 dataset from Kaggle, which contains 28,000 images for training and 4,000 images for testing, was used. To streamline the process, the dataset was subsampled to 9,000 images for training and 1,000 images for testing.

    Experiments were conducted with different optimizers, including RMSprop, SGD, and Adam. The model performed best with the RMSprop optimizer, achieving an accuracy of 55%. Various learning rates were also tested, with the model performing optimally at a learning rate of 0.001. After implementing a learning rate of 0.001, RMSprop optimizer, gradient clipping, and weight decay, the model achieved an accuracy of 56%.

  <h3>DATON (Detection And Tracking of Number Plates)</h3>
  <p>November 2023 – Jan 2024 | Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, Torchvision, YOLO</p><br>
  <p>This project is built using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow for real-time detection and tracking of vehicle number plates. Developed as part of the AI Club at Puducherry Technological University, the primary objective is to create a deep learning model capable of recognizing and tracking the number plates of vehicles entering and leaving the university premises. Information such as the entry time and license number is stored in a CSV file.
   <br>
    The prototype operates by processing a video input, which in a real-world scenario would be provided by a CCTV camera installed at the campus entrance. The YOLO V8 nano model is employed to detect cars, trucks, bikes, and other vehicles in the video frames. Each vehicle is then assigned a unique ID using the open-source SORT library, implemented in the sort folder. Once IDs are assigned, the next step involves detecting the vehicle's license plate using a pre-trained model called WPOD-NET, which is capable of recognizing number plates from eight different countries, including India. After detecting and cropping the license plate, the text is extracted using Python's EasyOCR library, along with a confidence score. Finally, the extracted results are stored in a CSV file.

  <h3>Neural Style Transfer Using Transformers</h3>
  <p>Jan 2024 – May 2024 | Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, Torchvision</p><br>
  <p>Neural Style Transfer (NST) has significantly evolved since its introduction with the pioneering work 
    by Gatys et al. in 2015. This method uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to blend the content 
    from one image with the style of another, revolutionizing artistic image creation and impacting various 
    domains such as media, fashion, and design.Existing systems predominantly employ CNNs and have started incorporating transformer architectures for style transfer, which facilitate better handling of long-range dependencies critical for capturing detailed artistic styles. However, these systems, including those using the Content-Aware Positional 
    Encoding (CAPE), face challenges with computational efficiency, particularly when processing 
    complex styles or high-resolution images. To address the limitations of CAPE and enhance system scalability and efficiency, the proposed model integrates Pyramidal Positional Encoding (PPE) with a transformer-based framework. PPE improves upon CAPE by incorporating a hierarchical, pyramid-like structure that captures spatial information at multiple scales. This method simplifies the encoding process, reduces computational demands, and 
    enhances the model's ability to generalize across different artistic styles and larger images, making it 
    more adaptable and faster. The proposed system also leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the stylization process dynamically. By using RL against the traditional loss function, the system can adjust its parameters in real-time based on the immediate feedback received from the output's quality assessment. This method 
    significantly accelerates the learning process, enabling quicker convergence and allowing the system to 
    produce higher quality stylized images with reduced computational resources. After 
    4000 epochs, content fidelity improved significantly to 2.0685, reflecting a reduction of content loss by 
    62.6% from initial values. Similarly, the system reduced global effects, or style loss, by 57.4% to 0.8578. 
    The inference time is impressively fast at just 1.39 seconds. Moreover, the integration of the 
    Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm further enhanced the system, reducing content fidelity to 
    2.0308 and global effects to 0.7473, with a minimal impact on inference time, which increased slightly 
    to 1.40 seconds.

  <h3>Full fleged Banking website</h3>
  <p>December 2022 – Jan 2023 | Java servlets, Bootstrap CSS, MYSQL database</p><br>
  <p>The website utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as front-end technologies, with Java Servlets, JSP (Java Server Pages), and MySQL as the back-end technologies. JDBC is employed to connect the backend to the database.
    <br>
    There are two types of users for this website: regular bank customers and individuals with a Bitcoin wallet. A regular bank customer can register on the website using their bank account number along with personal information. Once registered, they can log in using their account number and password, which redirects them to their homepage. After logging in, users can transfer money to another account through net banking, including both intra-bank and inter-bank transactions. Additionally, customers can access their e-statement, file complaints regarding transactions or other issues, and check their account balance.
    <br>
    The second type of customer comprises those with crypto wallets. These users can create an account on the website and transfer Bitcoin to another person using their Bitcoin address. They can also check the current Bitcoin market price and have the option to act as miners, processing transactions on a specific block in the blockchain.
    <br>
    Security is a priority for this website, with customer passwords being hashed using the HmacSHA-512 algorithm before being stored in the database. Salts are also added to the hashed passwords to enhance security.<br>
